# AGNESS
A.G.N.E.S.S. is a python project that learns how to play a deterministic board game given its rules.


To run AGNESS one must first write a rules file. The file called tictactoeRules.py is a template for the rules files.

Next run index.py. When the script finished running it will print the metaparameters used to define a player. 
These can then be used to create a montePlayer (see index.py for reference) that can play your game.

Good luck!
