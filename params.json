(Ai Gamer usiNg Evolutionary Strategy Searching) is a code that learns how to play any turn-based deterministic, non-random, zero-sum two player game. This is done by implementing a Monte Carlo Tree Search with hyperparameters that are found by an evolutionary algorithm. The cost function is calculated by letting the organisms (sets of hyperparameters) have a smaller tournament were the ranking is decided using the page rank algorithm.\r\n\r\n# How To Use\r\nTo run AGNESS one must first write a rules file. The file called tictactoeRules.py is a template for the rules files.\r\n\r\nNext run index.py. When the script finished running it will print the metaparameters used to define a player. \r\nThese can then be used to create a montePlayer (see index.py for reference) that can play your game.\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThe A.G.N.E.S.S. code is a Github project registered under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\nA.G.N.E.S.S. was created by Viktor Wase (@ViktorWase).
